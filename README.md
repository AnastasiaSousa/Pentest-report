# Pentest-report by Anastasiya Sousa

This pentest report demonstrates 3 phases of pentesting:

1. Reconnaissance to discover the IP address  of the victim (with **netdiscover** command)
2. Scanning to discover opened ports and services (with **nmap** command)
3. Gain access (to discovering the password with **Hydra** tool)

Next, will monitorize the traffic sent to the http and ssh services.
Then, will summarize the pentest results.
